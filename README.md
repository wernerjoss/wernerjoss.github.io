## wernerjoss.github.io

This is an incomplete Clone of my Grav Website at [https://hoernerfranzracing.de/werner/](https://hoernerfranzracing.de/werner/).  
It is intended as an exercise of how to create a static Site out of an existing [Grav](https://getgrav.org) Installation, currently done via the [Blackhole Plugin](https://github.com/barryanders/grav-plugin-blackhole).

### Known Issues:
-	Most Images (Fotos) are missing due to space Limitations
-	Pagination in Blog does not work
-	Categories/Tags Links do not work
-	Calendar is empty
-	Search does not work
